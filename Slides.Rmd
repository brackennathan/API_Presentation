## Problem!
  -Computers cannot easily use information that humans create on the web
  - Reading, Copying, and pasting thousands of data entries takes a long time
  - Lets get the "stupid" computer to understand inconsistent, "stupid" humans
---

## What is an API?
  - Picture from zapier
  - Client (Us): A program exchanges data with a server through an API 
  - API -> Application Programming Interface (stores computer digestible data)
  - Server: A powerful computer that hosts the API and Web Information
  - Key: This helps the computer read the data we see on a website
   
---

## Ok cool. How does this communication work?
  - Protocol: The "etiquette" underlying how computers communicate (e.g. HTTP).
  - Requests: What the client asks of the server
  - Make a request following the Protocol
  - This follows the request response cycle
---

## How do I make a request?
 - Requests conatain 4 things: 
    - URL 
    - Methods
    - List of Headers 
    - Body
---

## URL?
 - URL is an address on the internet for a thing that an API expands upon
  - Uniform Resource Locator
  - Key: The API "creates" URLs for more resources we see on the web

---
## Method? Similar to shell commands!
 - Methods: The "verbs" that clients use to talk with a server. 
  - Common Methods:
    - GET -> (i.e. ask a server to retrieve information) 
    - POST -> Ask for the creation of a new resource
    - PUT -> Edit or update existing resource
    - DELETE -> Delete a resource
 - Think of this as a data delivery
---

## Headers
  - The background (meta) information about the request
  - Time request was made
  - Size of the request body
---

## Body
  - The data the client wants to send to the server
  - Request details

---

## Great! We made our request!
  - We should get a "response"
  - Response: The server's response. 
  - This includes: 
    - a Status Code (e.g. "404" if not found, or "200" if successful)
    - a Header (i.e. meta-information about the reponse)
    - a Body (i.e the actual content that we're interested in).
