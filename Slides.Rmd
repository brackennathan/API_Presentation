## Problem!
  -Computers cannot easily use information that humans create on the web
  - Reading, Copying, and pasting thousands of data entries takes a long time
  - Lets get the "stupid" computer to understand inconsistent, "stupid" humans

## What is an API?
  - Picture from zapier
  - Client (Us): A program exchanges data with a server through an API 
  - API -> Application Programming Interface (stores computer digestible data)
  - Server: A powerful computer that hosts the API and Web Information
  - Key: This helps the computer read the data we see on a website

## Ok cool. How does this communication work?
  - Protocol: The "etiquette" underlying how computers communicate (e.g. HTTP).
  - Also Bluetooth, POP or IMAP for emails.
  - HTTP is the most common on the web, most companies use this
---
Methods: The "verbs" that clients use to talk with a server. The main one that we'll be using is GET (i.e. ask a server to retrieve information), but other common methods are POST, PUT and DELETE.

---
Requests: What the client asks of the server (see Methods above).

---
Response: The server's response. This includes a Status Code (e.g. "404" if not found, or "200" if successful), a Header (i.e. meta-information about the reponse), and a Body (i.e the actual content that we're interested in).
